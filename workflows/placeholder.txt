So... 

I've got various modules in the root of the folder 'above' this one... 
But, those are just Cmdlets and the likes. 

meaning, that I'll have modules for things like: 
- S3 Backups and stuff. 
- S4.Core (maybe? but, yeah, probably - things like: email alerts, Prompt-ForWhatever, and other 'View'-level related details...)
- Proviso
- Capacity Planning, etc. 

And, here is where I'll create the .ps1 'scripts' or 'automation' that creates, effectively, 'controllers' 
for those 'models' - i.e., orchestration and the likes. 

With the idea that the scripts in here - i.e., the workflows won't be HARD-CODED 100% 'exact'. 
Instead, they're samples/examples/real-world-implementations that showcase (by means of really doing stuff)
WHAT can be done via the modules (functionality) listed above...
